# CodingChallenge
A small web application consisting of backend

## Description
The Feedback form: the user can open the page or send an API request,
provide his feedback title, and summary. After the successful response, the
page or API will show a thank you message. Additional page or API exists to
get a list of submitted feedbacks.

## Testing
I used Postman to test the API. <br />
To submit a feedback (POST): http://localhost:3000/posts <br />
To get list of all submitted feedbacks (GET):http://localhost:3000/posts <br />

*Usually I would not include the dotenv file but this is a test db with no sensitive data
